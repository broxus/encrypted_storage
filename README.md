This package provides a fast and simple way to store and retrieve encrypted data usind [sqflite][sqflite_link]. It uses AES encryption via [encrypt][encrypt_link] to encrypt the data and [flutter_secure_storage][flutter_secure_storage_link] to store key and initialization vector.

## Installation üíª

**‚ùó In order to start using Encrypted Storage you must have the [Flutter SDK][flutter_install_link] installed on your machine.**

Add `encrypted_storage` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  encrypted_storage:
```

Install it:

```sh
flutter packages get
```

---

## Getting Started üöÄ

Install melos:

```sh
$ dart pub global activate melos
```

Using [melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/) makes it very easy to work with the project, so enjoy.

Boostrap packages recursively:

```sh
$ melos bs
```

## Codegen ü¶æ

This thing will run all code generators for all packages:

```
$ melos run codegen
```

## Code format checking and analyser ü¶†

```
$ melos run check-format
$ melos run analyze
```

## Clean up üßπ

To clean up all packages just run:

```
$ melos clean
```

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ melos test
```

## Pre-commit preparation ü¶†üß™ü§è

To run code format check, analyzer and all tests use the following command:

```sh
$ melos check-all
```

## Package version üî¢

Package version is defined in `pubspec.yaml` file. To bump the version use the following command:

```sh
# For development releases:
$ melos version -a --yes --prerelease

# For production releases:
$ melos version -a --yes --graduate
```

You can use version workflow in GitHub actions to bump the version automatically. This workflow will create a new branch and PR (because push to main is prohibited) with the new version. Don't forget to merge the PR to main! Note: you should use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to make it work.

## Github Secrets üîë

`BOT_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. We should use PAT and not default GITHUB_TOKEN because ["When you use the repository's GITHUB_TOKEN to perform tasks, events triggered by the GITHUB_TOKEN, with the exception of workflow_dispatch and repository_dispatch, will not create a new workflow run"](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow). We want to trigger a workflow from the workflow (to run tests), so we need to use PAT. This thing is used in `version` workflow.
